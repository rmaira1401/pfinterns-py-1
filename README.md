# Python Generator
Create a password generator tool using Python. The tool will allow users to specify
password criteria such as length and character set and generate random passwords
accordingly. The completed project should include a command-line or GUI interface
where users can input password criteria. It should generate random passwords based on
the specified criteria and provide options for copying the generated passwords to the
clipboard. Interns will practice string manipulation and randomization techniques. They'll
gain an understanding of password security principles and learn how to create secure
passwords. Basic Python programming, familiarity with string manipulation, knowledge of
GUI development (if implementing a GUI) are required to do this.
